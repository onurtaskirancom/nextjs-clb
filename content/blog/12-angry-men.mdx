12 men in one room. It's a great movie. A movie that appeals to your mind. The actors are much more natural than today's actors, and the characters they portray are sincere and realistic. The movie runs for over an hour and a half and there is no action, just conversation. The acting is so natural that it's as if they improvised the entire movie. It is truly impressive that the director created a masterpiece with so little. When examined from a philosophical perspective, the film deals with the justice system and ethical issues in depth.

The process of evaluating jurors' decisions from an ethical perspective makes the viewer think about the subjective and objective dimensions of justice.

The fact that the jury members come from different backgrounds causes them to confront social prejudices and stereotypes throughout the film. This makes the viewer think about how people should get rid of prejudices that can affect their decisions.

The juror, played by Henry Fonda, acts under the guidance of his individual conscience. The film questions how the individual's inner values ​​and conscience stand against society's expectations.

Jurors question the evidence presented, and in the process, epistemological questions arise about the difficulties of understanding the truth. The issues of what information is reliable and how the truth is determined play an important role in the film.

The fact that the jury is a democratic institution causes the film to question democratic processes and decision-making mechanisms. Issues such as the difficulties of democracy, majority oppression and minority rights are discussed in the film.

The characters in the film face their own freedom and responsibility for their decisions.

The film directs the audience to think about basic philosophical issues such as social problems, justice, ethics, freedom and responsibility.
