It is one of the best TV series I've seen. The plot of the TV series is very well edited. I think its value is not understood. But it doesn't matter. This doesn't change the fact that the Tv series is good. The character in the series is a man like Arsen Lupen. This Tv series shows what a man who hit rock bottom can do. There is a lot of action in every episode and has a great story, very good at acting.

Watching only the first episode is enough to understand the quality of the series.

The soundtrack of the series is also good. It is their music that makes such things beautiful.

here is one of them
