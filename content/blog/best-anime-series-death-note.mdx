This anime series is the best in anime. Also this is the only anime for me. Because I'm someone who doesn't watch anime. I tried to watch a few anime series but I didn't like it and stopped watching. When I first watched Death Note, I watched all the episodes back to back. I think Death Note is my first and last anime. If you haven't watched Death note, you should definitely watch it before you die because there is something that makes it important. So what makes this anime important? Of course, what makes this anime series important is that it makes the audience question something philosophically. What does the Death Note anime tell you philosophically? Yes, this anime makes people question the concepts of morality and justice. It makes us question the concepts of good and evil.

Generally, most anime genres are action, war, adventure. Death Note goes beyond other
ordinary anime with its psychological thriller genre. Its complex plot is explained
simply for you, and the story is very clever. As you watch, you almost feel that
every single one of your brain cells is working. Especially the music of the anime
is a great fuel for the human brain. Here you can listen to the music.

If I were to criticize the anime, is there a logic error? Of course, nothing is perfect.
There are logic errors in this anime too. I will tell one of them without giving
spoilers. Kira immediately falls into the trap that L set up on TV to reveal the
criminal's location. This is where the anime is very simple but it still does not
detract from the quality of this anime. I was able to ignore it and watch it comfortably.
After all, the main subject that the author wants to tell us is different. what the
author wants to convey is justice and morality.

So who was right in this anime series? Should we be on L's side or Kira's? this anime does not give us a clear answer as to which side we should be on. This leaves the answer up to you.

Yes, friends, it's 2023 and Death Note still maintains its first place in the anime world. Watch it if you haven't. If you've watched it, recommend it to those who haven't. I've watched it from start to finish twice and it never gets old.

Storyline:

After an intelligent yet cynical high school student begins to cleanse the world from evil with the help of a magical notebook that can kill anyone whose name is written on it, international authorities call upon a mysterious detective known as "L" to thwart his efforts - imdb
