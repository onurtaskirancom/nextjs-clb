I'm talking about the themes I use in VSCode, so in my opinion, these are the best themes. The themes I mentioned below are the best themes I have ever enjoyed using. Sometimes it's good to change themes while writing code because change is always good. Sometimes changing themes motivates me while writing code. So, I feel in a different atmosphere while writing code.

I do not share themes with different designs here. Therefore, there may be similarities between themes. So in short, these are the themes I've been using lately. There may be a theme among them that you like. So enjoy.

### GitHub Dark Default

If you like Github's own themes, you can use them. I used this theme for a long time. pretty good. It does not tire the eyes and the color selection is good. It has been downloaded more than 9 million times to date. A popular choice among developers. It has been appreciated by most software developers.

### Night Owl

One of the themes I like is the Night Owl theme. Designed for night workers. It really doesn't tire the eyes. I don't like the color purple, but purple can sometimes look nice in code themes. Yes, the colors look really nice in this theme too. It is a popular theme among developers. It has been downloaded more than 2 million times.

> About the theme:
> A Visual Studio Code theme for the night owls out there. Fine-tuned for those of us who like to code late into the night. Color choices have taken into consideration what is accessible to people with colorblindness and in low-light circumstances. Decisions were also based on meaningful contrast for reading comprehension and for optimal razzle dazzle.

### CyberPunk

There are a lot of purple colors available in this theme. I used it for a very short time. I switched to this theme when I got bored with other themes. It's not good compared to the themes I use. It seems like something is missing in this theme. Would I use it again? If I get bored, maybe I can use it for a short time.

> About the theme:
> I know, it may look like a rainbow and even give the sensation of distraction. But fundamentally I chose the cyberpunk theme, because it allows me to use a very wide color palette, this helps each fragment of code to have practically a color, so our eye quickly detects color changes and our brain is processing and memorizing the information received. This can help unconsciously improve your productivity when programming, as we recognize quickly, for example: if it is an object, a class, a method, etc...
