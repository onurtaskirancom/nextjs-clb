I just watched all the episodes of the series. It's a pretty good series. I got bored while watching the first season, but the series gets better in the later episodes. As you know, the series is a sequel to Breaking Bad. That's why I wanted to watch the series. Also, one of the biggest reasons why I watch the series is the character Mike Ehrmantraut. Jonathan Banks is a terrific actor. He reflected the character very well. I also liked her acting while watching the TV series Breaking Bad.

Many people say that this series is better than Breaking Bad, but I disagree. The series is like Breaking Bad, but not better. Better Call Saul is a good series, but to say it is better than Breaking Bad would be nonsense.

The characters of Nacho Varga and Lalo Salamanca were also very good in the series. Only a better scenario could have been written for the character of Nacho Varga.

If you are a Breaking Bad fan, you should definitely watch this series. I hope such TV series will be produced in the coming years.
