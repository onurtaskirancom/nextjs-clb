I generally like period movies and TV series. Black Sails is one of the productions that best reflects its period. Costume design, set design, ships, etc. in the series. All extremely well done. The acting is very believable and quite good, especially Flint's acting is very good. This series was one where I felt like I was watching Pirates of the Caribbean.

While the series gradually explains the evil of Captain Flint, it also tells how John Silver, one of the interesting characters, gradually became a Pirate. The first season moves slowly. Keep watching even if you get bored and think of quitting. In the following episodes, the series reaches much better levels in terms of subject and shooting. Sometimes an episode can even have the quality of a movie.

There are people who have never heard of Black Sails. I think the value of the series is not understood enough because the effort and high-quality acting do not deserve so little attention.

Yes, I watched this series years ago. I think I'm longing for a series like this. If you are interested in a series full of historical adventure, pirates, political intrigue and complex characters, you should watch Black Sails, one of the best productions.
