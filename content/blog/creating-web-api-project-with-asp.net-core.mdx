Let's create our project from powershell screen with dotnet cli commands. I click Start, type PowerShell, and then click Windows PowerShell. First of all, I see that my file is empty with the ls command. I am creating my onurnet folder with the mkdir onurnet command and then I go into my file with the cd onurnet command.

Now what I'm going to do is check out the help options.

The one we can look at now is the dot net new command, which allows us to create new dot net projects or dot net files.

  alt="onurtaskiran"

And we're also going to create a solution for our project. we use the dotnet new sln command for this.

  alt="onurtaskiran"

And this gets created successfully.

We create our api project with dotnet new webapi -o API command.

Yes, our project has been successfully created. now let's go have a look.

  alt="onurtaskiran"

We go into our API folder.

What was the code where we could see all the files? It was the code of ls. We write the code for ls

  alt="onurtaskiran"

There is no sln in our API folder. I want to be able to run the API alone. When we create more than one project, we may want to run it separately. So I'll add another sln

  alt="onurtaskiran"
/>

With the dotnet sln -h command, we are looking at auxiliary methods.

  alt="onurtaskiran"
/>

We add sln with the dotnet sln add API command.

So now what we have is a solution that contains a project. Then we type the dotnet sln list command.

code . If we type the command, the project will open the code environment for us.

Here is the result.

If you want, you can also open the project with visual studio.

We can open our terminal using ctrl and apostrophes, then enter the api file with the cd API command and run the project with the dotnet run command.

And inside our project here, what we're given when we create it is this weather forecast class. We're going to make a request to our API and make sure that our project is working.

We run the postman.

https://localhost:5001/weatherforecast

We can view it in our web browser.

that's all for now.

to be continued.
