If you are trying to run Docker for Windows within a virtual machine, you need to enable 'Nested Virtualization'. You need to upgrade your windows to the latest version and you also need to enable virtualization in BIOS. I used docker for the first time a few days ago and got an error. Even though I did virtualization, I kept getting errors.

> Unable to find image 'xxxx' locally

First of all, I installed the docker on my computer and then I marked the containers and Hyper-V features. so i got an error then I deleted docker completely and did the virtualization. so the error was fixed.

So what will we do, here is the simple solution

Open "Turn windows features on or off" from Control Panel

Remove the selections from containers and Hyper-V

Restart the computer

Mark the containers and Hyper-V features as selected

Restart your computer again

Install and run docker.
