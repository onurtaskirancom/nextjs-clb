The movie is told through the eyes of the leading actor. So it is like you're playing a computer game. I really felt like I was at the beginning of a computer game when I first watched it. Making such a film is undoubtedly a brave act. If you are a computer games enthusiast, this is the kind of movie you will love. Yes, the camera is on our man's face and you watch the movie from there. What a crazy movie I liked it very much and watched it 3 times. I don't easily watch a movie a second time.

Some people made ridiculous comments such as I was very dizzy, my head hurt, there was no plot and there was too much action. I don't believe that people who love technology will think like this. Those who criticize are generally people who are far from technology or are old people.

The movie is very successful and a must-watch movie. It may not have a very good plot, but it is a top-notch movie in terms of action scenes. I've never watched a movie before that was reflected only through the eyes of the leading actor. I also think that movies like this will increase. Even if there are no such movies in the future, some of its scenes can be reflected this way.

Even if you watch the trailer, you will understand that it is beautiful.

I suggest you watch it, bye
