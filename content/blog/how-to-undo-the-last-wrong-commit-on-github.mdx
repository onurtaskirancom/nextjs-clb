When we send what we need to send to Github, there is an easy way to get it back. sometimes i can send wrong commit. That's when I immediately delete the commits and post them again. We can undo as many commits as we want from both local and remote repository.

First, let's send the wrong commit

```javascript
git add .
git commit -m "false commit"
git push origin master
```

The first code we will write will undo the local repository by one commit

```javascript
git reset --hard Head~1
```

If you want to delete more commits, you can increase the number after Head~.

Now let's undo the commit from github too... This is very simple to do. We just add a plus to the beginning of the master in our git push origin master code.

```javascript
git push origin +master
```

When you do this, we are doing a force update. So, we cleared both local and remote repository from the last commit.

Keep coding.
