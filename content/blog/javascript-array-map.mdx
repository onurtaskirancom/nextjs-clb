The map function processes the elements of the array or object one by one and returns them. So it's doing the conversion. We use it a lot when developing applications. With map, we change something and assign it to something new without breaking the existing structure.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

const newNumbers = numbers.map(function (number) {
  return number * 2;
});

console.log(newNumbers);
```

Multiplies each element by 2 and returns.

Output: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]`

We can use it with objects as well as with arrays.

```javascript
const books = [
  { name: "1", pageNumber: 50 },
  { name: "2", pageNumber: 22 },
  { name: "3", pageNumber: 79 },
];

const PageNumbers = books.map(function (book) {
  return book.pageNumber;
});

console.log(PageNumbers);
```

Output: `[50, 22, 79]`

Objects with name and surname are kept in array. Let's print them as name and surname

```javascript
const persons = [
  { name: "Marlon", surname: "Brando" },
  { name: "James", surname: "Dean" },
  { name: "Marilyn ", surname: "Monroe" },
];

const newNames = persons.map((person) => person.name + " " + person.surname);
console.log(newNames);
```

Output: `["Marlon Brando", "James Dean", "Marilyn Monroe"]`

When we write this way, we don't use both curly braces and return statements.
