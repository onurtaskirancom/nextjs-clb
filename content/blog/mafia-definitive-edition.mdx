The mafia game, which has a beautiful story, is presented to the players with its new technological design. Developed by Hangar 13, the mafia game meets the players with many innovations. We start the story by driving a taxi as in the first game then we start working in the mafia and the game continues in cinematic form. I has played  this game in 2006 year. I'm playing with its new design today. One of the best games i have played. It immediately puts you in the atmosphere of the 1930s. Mafia has the best story in the entire series. Mafia 2 was also liked, but Mafia 3 was not liked very much.

The only thing missing in my opinion is that there is no camera inside while driving. I can ignore other minor mistakes. Car use is much more comfortable and better than the first game. With the Mafia Definitive Edition cinematics, it makes the great story better. I did not get any software errors while playing the game. I liked it very much and found it perfect. I also recommend you to play Mafia Definitive Edition. I will continue to play games like this, even if I get old one day.

Storyline

> Set within the fictional city of Lost Heaven, Illinois (based on Chicago) during the 1930s, the story follows the rise and fall of a Lost Heaven Sicilian-American mobster, Tommy Angelo within the Salieri crime family. Alongside the story mode, players can also explore the city in an open world mode, which features side missions and the ability to find secrets at their own leisure. The remake brought with it several improvements to the original's story and gameplay, including a rebuilt setting, enhanced mission dynamics, and the introduction of motorcycles to the series. While most of the veteran Czech Mafia voice cast returned for the new installment, the English voices were recast. In addition, developers created an original score for the remake.

The rearrangement of many things shows that there is a lot of effort involved. The company that prepared the game did a good job.
