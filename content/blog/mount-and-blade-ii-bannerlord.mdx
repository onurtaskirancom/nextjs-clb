I've been playing Mount & Blade II Bannerlord for a few days now. A great game to kill time. I can't understand how the time passes in the game. So I can play this video game for months, years without getting tired. One of the best of the genre. At the beginning of the game, we create the facial features and body structure of our character ourselves. I've always loved games that start like this. Because personalizing the character is important to me. There are 6 civilizations in Bannerlord. At the beginning of the game we have to choose civilization. Of course, every civilization has its pros and cons. I started by choosing the kuzaits. If you choose the empire, you will play much more comfortably. Yes, I chose the civilization that is closer to me and I can't say that I had a hard time.

They have also included a scenario mode so that we can get used to the game more easily. yes, we are left alone in the big world at first in the game and long adventures await us in this world.

What makes Mount & Blade II Bannerlord different from other games is that you create your own scenario, your own history in this game. The fighting animations are pretty good. Bannerlord offers pretty good combat experience. You really feel like you went to historical civilizations and participated in wars with those people.

Although I'm not someone who spends a lot of time on video games, if I find a video game I like, I will play it. I mean, I'm not like people who spend their lives in video games, and I don't want to be like those people. For me, playing a game you love is like watching a good movie in the style you love.

I care a lot about graphics in a game, but I didn't care about the graphic design of this game. Because Bannerlord is a very cleverly designed video game. The bad graphics are not too noticeable because you enjoy playing the game. Strategy games have been my favorite since childhood. I've played Total War Rome 2 a lot. and this game includes action as well as strategy. In other words, going into battles with your own soldiers and fighting one-on-one takes the game to very different points.

I congratulate TaleWorlds for releasing such a game. They really did a good job.

I must say that Bannerlord is a very addictive game. I stopped playing this game in order not to waste any more time, but whenever I want to kill time, I can say that this is the game I will go back to play. Would I recommend it to everyone? I would never recommend it to anyone who doesn't have the time. But if you like Strategy - Action game, you should play it at least once.

Yes, good software developers and designers should come together and produce good games, right? The world needs such things.
