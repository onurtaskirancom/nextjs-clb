This series is definitely a hidden gem. The story is amazing from beginning to end. So, while watching it, I felt the quality of Hollywood TV series. A show that is so good and so underrated. I can say that it is one of the rare good TV series I have watched. In summary, it is a good and entertaining series. The fact that the series' episodes are short makes it even better. The best aspect of the series is that the lead character behaves very realistically. In this case, while watching the series, it makes you feel as if you are watching a slice of real life.

A feature of the character played by Scott Ryan is that in fight or flight situations, the character can choose to fight. In other words, the character's direct aggression without having too much dialogue with people increases the viewing pleasure.

If you're having trouble finding something to watch lately, I suggest you give this series a try.
