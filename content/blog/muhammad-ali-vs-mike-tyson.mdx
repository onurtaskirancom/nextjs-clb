Who would win? Of course, I cannot answer easily. Most people will say that Muhammad Ali will win. But if we look logically, is this the case? Muhammad Ali has an advantage in terms of speed and Mike Tyson has an advantage in terms of power. I think they're both the best boxers of all time... When they asked Muhammad Ali about this, he said Mike wins. Mike said that Ali will win. I guess I would never want such a fight to happen. Muhammad Ali has a great character and all people love him so is Mike Tyson. I think if these two great boxers had a match, Mike would have won. In my opinion, contrary to popular belief, Muhammad Ali could not have won the match. Mike would be the winner by knockout. In a fight, anything can happen, but I say that Muhammad Ali would have lost this match, although I would admit that it was the best. Such men will never be born again. Mike is still a living legend.
