I changed the design of my blog page and updated its coding. Here is the speed of my blog site according to Google. The first thing I prioritize for a website is speed. I can even make changes to the programming languages â€‹â€‹I use for this. By the way, of course I chose Next JS for my website. It's a super technology. As you can see the speed is very good. I have blog pages that open very quickly.

Here is the score given by Google:

As I said, speed is important ðŸ˜Ž

Nexjs is fast, but the strategies we use in our coding will also enable us to produce faster sites. Nexjs caches pages automatically. We can customize page cache and improve performance. We also need to adapt to new emerging technologies. For example, tailwindcss can speed up our site because it offers a smaller file size. Yes, I prefer tailwindcss instead of using normal css. By enabling HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 on your server, we can take advantage of multiple streams and other performance benefits.

Every project is different, so it is necessary to carefully determine the work that can be done to increase website speed.

Goodbye, have a nice day. Happy coding.
