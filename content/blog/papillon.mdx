Papillon is one of the best movies for me. If you read the Papillon book, you will understand the movie better. The movie does not reflect the book exactly, we cannot expect it to reflect anyway. Steve McQueen's great acting captured the spirit of the book into the film. I think Steve McQueen is the best actor after Marlon Brando. I can say this movie is the best he played. Steve McQueen portrayed Henri Charriere's horrifying life very well. What is the life of Henri Charriere? Can a person have such a life? What a great sin a person must commit for such bad things to happen to him? I couldn't help asking these questions.

Henri Charriere tells us about patience, fighting spirit, determination, and most importantly the importance of having freedom. I have seen very few people with such a determined and unwavering spiritual structure. You can learn a lot about life from Henri Charriere, so I strongly recommend reading his book. Most people would have given up and settle for their fate if they had lived his life. They remade the movie but didn't get the same quality so you should watch the old movie. I watched in two movies but I liked the old one more. I think the movie should be in every moviegoer's archive, and the book should be in every individual's library. I hope you will fight like Henry in the difficulties you face.

Storyline

A semi-fictional account of Henri Charrière's time in the penal system in French Guyana - some of it spent on infamous Devil's Island - is presented. It's the early 1930s. Charrière - nicknamed Papillon because of his butterfly tattoo - and Louis Dega are two among many who have been convicted in the French judicial system, they now being transferred to French Guyana where they will serve their time, never to return to France even if they are ever released. A safe-cracker by criminal profession, Papillon is serving a life sentence for murdering a pimp, a crime for which he adamantly states he was framed. Dega is a wealthy counterfeiter, who expects his well-to-do wife eventually to get him released. At Papillon's initiative, the duo enters into a business arrangement: Papillon will provide protection for Dega, who, in turn, will finance Papillon's escape attempt. As the two men spend more time together than either had expected, their burgeoning friendship ends up being an importan.
