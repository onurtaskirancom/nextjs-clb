I can say that it is one of the quality TV series I have watched. The first season of the series progresses a little slowly, but as it progresses, it becomes legendary. The acting is really good. Tommy Shelby, played by Cillian Murphy, is the gang leader and the brains of the Shelbys, who makes very clever moves. His older brother, Arthur, is lacking in intelligence, but we can say that he is the fist of the Shelbys in terms of strength and nerves. At first, Arthur is shown to be the leader, but it is Tommy who leads the Shelbys. Then Tommy will take full leadership. Tommy gains the sympathy of the audience with his clever moves. His brother Arthur is not a idle man either, he endears himself to the audience with his aggressive, rebellious and predatory attitudes.

The series takes place in the last half of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century. They reflected the period they wanted to describe in terms of costumes, objects and environment very well on the screen.

Shelbys are famous for the razor blades they wear on their hats. When they fight, they blind their opponents with their hats. The Peaky Blinders gang is not fictional. It is based on events that have happened before. In this case, it makes the series different.

We see Tom Hardy as the Jewish mafia in the series. By the way, Tom Hardy is the best actor for me after Marlon Brando and Steve McQueen.

In the following episodes, Adrien Brody, whom we know from the movie The Pianist, appears before the Shelbys as the Italian Mafia. Especially the Shelbys' war with the Italians was full of action and excitement.
