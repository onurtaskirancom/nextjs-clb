Managing software development projects and collaborating with other software developers is very important. Using GitHub for managing and collaborating on projects is very popular. GitHub allows users to host their projects, perform version control, and collaborate with other users. GitHub is a common collaboration platform for open source projects, but also supports private projects. It is used to make the software development processes of both individuals and large companies more effective and collaborative.

If you don't have an account, I recommend going to GitHub and creating one. Creating an account on GitHub is quite simple. How will we push our code to GitHub? This process is very simple. First, we go to GitHub and log in. Then we click create a new repository in a control panel.

Determine and create a repository name

The important thing here is to create the .gitignore file. We don't want to deploy everything from our projects to the GitHub repository. For example, we add node_modules to .gitignore.

```javascript
/node_modules
```

Now let's continue with the commands. The first command is git init.

```javascript
git init
```

The second command is git status

```javascript
git status
```

  alt="onurtaskiran"
/>

Notice there is no node module here. Git status will be listed. Now you can transfer all your files and folders to the GitHub repository.

Our next command

```javascript
git add .
```

It means I want to include all files. We execute the git status command again.

```javascript
git status
```

  alt="onurtaskiran"
/>

All files should now be green so they are ready to be processed. Our next command will be writing a commit message. The message must be meaningful for your project

```javascript
git commit -m "Data Model created"
```

  alt="onurtaskiran"
/>

```javascript
git status
```

  alt="onurtaskiran"
/>

Here you will see that there is nothing to commit in Branch Master.

```javascript
git branch -M master
```

Next code

```javascript
git remote add origin https://github.com/onurtaskirancom/ecommerce-api.git
```

Go here and type remote -v and you will see that you have a remote branch.

```javascript
git remote -v
```

  alt="onurtaskiran"
/>

Now our local code and remote repository are connected. Now we can push our code to GitHub repository with git command.

```javascript
git push -u origin master
```

  alt="onurtaskiran"
/>

All of our code has been pushed to GitHub. I go to the browser and I should see your code here.

This is perfect

The commands I wrote respectively.

```javascript
git init
git status
git add .
git status
git commit -m "first commit"
git status
git branch -M master
git remote add origin https://github.com/onurtaskirancom/MernEcommerceApi.git
git remote -v
git push -u origin master
```

Happy coding.
