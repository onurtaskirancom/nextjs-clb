This game, which gives us a life almost like in the real world, is beyond legendary to me. Rockstar Games has produced this game perfectly. When I played this video game, I felt like I was living in a real life. It really sends you to another world. If I were to criticize and disparage the game, I would have nothing to say. I won't tell you what I found anyway

What I found in this game is excellent graphics, quality cinematic, nice dialogues with the characters, realistic story and more. I never got bored playing this video game. And then, none of the Missions seemed silly to me. It is very realistic and there are many details, for example, you modeled your hair short and when you want to grow it again, you expect your hair to grow like in real life Or If you do not take an animal you hunted to the butcher for a long time, the meat of the animal begins to rot and becomes worthless or If your horse is injured. And you cannot heal it, your horse dies etc.

There may be robbers who block your way in the game, and sometimes gangs of children can trap you or rich people trying to lock their dirty work on you. There is everything expected from such a world in this game. If you haven't played Red Dead Redemption 2 yet, you should.

After a robbery goes badly wrong in the western town of Blackwater, Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang are forced to flee. With federal agents and the best bounty hunters in the nation massing on their heels, the gang must rob, steal and fight their way across the rugged heartland of America in order to survive. As deepening internal divisions threaten to tear the gang apart, Arthur must make a choice between his own ideals and loyalty to the gang who raised him.

From the creators of Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an epic tale of life in America at the dawn of the modern age.
