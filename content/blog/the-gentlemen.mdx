I haven't been able to watch such a good movie lately. I think this movie is going to be a cult movie and it's a really great work and the acting is at the highest level and the subject is really immersive. Each of them has their own style and charisma. Each of them delivers a terrific performance. Some people said we had trouble understanding and I think they might be right because the movie doesn't want low IQ and you shouldn't watch this movie while you're distracted and as I said Best new film I've seen in a while, thoroughly enjoyed it. Guy Ritchie has done an amazing job as always.

By the way, the soundtrack is very good too

here is one of them

Listen to the music man and go watch the movie. If a movie's soundtrack and cast is good, quality is inevitable. It deserves awards because movies like this are really hard to see these days. Anyway, there is no need to talk too much. Sit back and enjoy the movie.
