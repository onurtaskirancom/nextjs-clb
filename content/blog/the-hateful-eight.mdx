I can say it's Quentin Tarantino's Best Movie. I would definitely put The Hateful Eight or Pulp Fiction first. This movie may not appeal to everyone's taste, but it is a very Under rated movie. It's actually a very, very good movie. Every scene is magnificent. I think Tarantino gives me my expectations from the movie. Do you know how I watched this movie? I watched this movie without knowing it was Tarantino's movie. And no matter what, I watched a random movie just to watch it. It was one of the movies I watched to distract myself on a day when I was careless. At the beginning of the movie, I didn't pay attention to who the director was and who the actors were. I was surprised as the movie progressed, and my surprise ended when I saw that it was a Tarantino movie at the end.

The Hateful Eight Movie does not have as much action as Django, but it has a very different atmosphere. Yes, the movie is very long and moves slowly, but the movie makes you lose track of time.

> Storyline:

> Some time after the Civil War, a stagecoach hurtles through the wintry Wyoming landscape. Bounty hunter John Ruth and his fugitive captive Daisy Domergue race towards the town of Red Rock, where Ruth will bring Daisy to justice. Along the road, they encounter Major Marquis Warren (an infamous bounty hunter) and Chris Mannix (a man who claims to be Red Rock's new sheriff). Lost in a blizzard, the bunch seeks refuge at Minnie's Haberdashery. When they arrive they are greeted by unfamiliar faces: Bob, who claims to be taking care of the place while Minnie is gone; Oswaldo Mobray, the hangman of Red Rock; Joe Gage, a cow puncher; and confederate general Sanford Smithers. As the storm overtakes the mountainside, the eight travelers come to learn that they might not make it to Red Rock after all
