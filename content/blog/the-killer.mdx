I watched this movie last night. I waited a long time for the movie to come out. The reason why I put this movie on my waiting list is, of course, the director David Fincher's work is very good. The fact that David Fincher is the director of great films such as Fight Club, Seven, The Game and The Social Network shows that he is a quality filmmaker. Therefore, one inevitably has expectations for a new movie of his.

Yes, I watched the movie with great pleasure last night. It was one of the beautiful movies I watched recently because good movies cannot be produced lately. Therefore, the people who create such quality films deserve all the praise. It is very sad for humanity that neither quality films nor TV series have been produced lately. Wouldn't it be nice if there were TV series that were better than Game of Thrones and better than Breaking Bad?

It's a much better movie than the movies on the market. You can see people who didn't like the movie because people had high expectations from it. Therefore, they could not find what they wanted in the movie. They make comments like the script is not good, boring and not predictable. The script could have been a little better, but I can still say it was adequate. Although it's not a very good movie, it's not a bad movie either. I think the movie is good. The director is good, the actor is good. Michael Fassbender did a great job as always.
