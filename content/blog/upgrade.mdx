This movie is one of my favorite movies. I watched last night.I don't know why I didn't watch it when it first came out. A very, very good movie. I strongly recommend you to watch. Logan Marshall-Green performed well. That man is similar to Tom Hardy. I think this two men very good stars.

The film shows what can be done with artificial intelligence. Can artificial intelligence bring the end of humanity? raises the question. I think artificial intelligence will not end humanity because it is not a mind. Human mind overcomes everything. you underestimate the human mind. However, it is the human mind that creates all kinds of technology. Human mind is everything. is the only way to survive and live. Artificial intelligence can think like a human, but man somehow finds his way. What they said I will either find a way or make one. The end of the movie is surprise. You should watch the movie

About the movie:

Set in the near-future, technology controls nearly all aspects of life. But when the world of Grey, a self-labeled technophobe, is turned upside down, his only hope for revenge is an experimental computer chip implant.
