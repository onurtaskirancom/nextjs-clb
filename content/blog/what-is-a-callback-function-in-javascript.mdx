Callbacks are functions passed to other functions to be called inside the outer function. it is any function called by another function using a parameter. when we pass a function to another function and it is executed in that function, we can call it a callback. Callbacks are used a lot in coding. callback is very useful for asynchronous behavior where we want an event to occur when an event is completed.

Let's take a quick look at a simple example.

```javascript
function testHi(test) {
  test();
  test();
  test();
}

function message() {
  console.log("hello world!");
}
testHi(message);
```

output:

```javascript
hello world!

hello world!

hello world!
```

in this example message is a callback

Let's examine our example that prints the entered color on the console screen.

```javascript
function writeColor(color) {
  console.log("Color: " + color);
}

function color(callback) {
  let color = prompt("enter a color.");
  callback(color);
}

color(writeColor);
```

Let's do another example. We take two values ​​and print them to the screen as lowercase and uppercase letters.

```javascript
function user(username, email) {
  console.log("username: " + username + " " + "email: " + email);
}
user("onur", "onur@onurtaskiran.com");

function User2(username, email, callback) {
  const user =
    "username: " +
    username.toUpperCase() +
    " " +
    "email: " +
    email.toUpperCase();
  callback(user);
}

User2("onur", "onur@onurtaskiran.com", function (mail) {
  console.log(mail);
});
```

output:

```javascript
username: onur email: onur@onurtaskiran.com
username: ONUR email: ONUR@ONURTASKIRAN.COM
```

We use callbacks a lot in javascript so we can do asynchronous programming.
