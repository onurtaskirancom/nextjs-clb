I have been doing Wim Hof Method for one year. It was very easy for me to do the Wim Hof Method as I always take a cold shower after sports. The Wim Hof ​​Method consists of three components: breathing exercises, training your mindset and concentration, and gradual exposure to cold. I have been doing the other two items for years apart from breathing exercises. After adding breathing exercises, my lung capacity increased even more. Also, the time I hold my breath has almost doubled.I still continue to do the Wim Hof ​​Method. I think I will continue to do so from now on. I have seen the benefits and if you are healthy, that is, if you do not have a disease, I recommend you to do it.

People who do Wim Hof for the first time may experience dizziness and nausea. I did not see any side effects when I tried the Wim Hof Method for the first time. I guess thin people who do not do sports may experience side effects at first, but then they get better.

If you find it difficult to enter cold water, first put your feet in the water and then your arms, so it will be easier to enter the water. Cold water becomes addictive after a while and you want to take a shower with cold water even in winter.

If you can't lift 100 kilos on the first day you start exercising, you can do it very easily in the future. Here too, stand in cold water for 30 seconds on the first day and increase the time over time. After a while you will be able to stand in cold water for more than 10 minutes and it will make you very strong.

You can learn how to do the Wim Hof ​​Method from the website or youtube videos.
